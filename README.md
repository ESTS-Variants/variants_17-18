# Variants 17-18 | the `pre-pandoc` branch

As explained in our [varianTeX wiki](https://github.com/ESTS-Variants/varianTeX/wiki), we are working with a PDF-first publication workflow. This means that we copy-edit our issue in LaTeX, in a way that it can be compiled as a finalized, typeset PDF version of the complete issue -- before we then automaticaly transform the LaTeX into the (Word) files our publication platform ([OpenEdition](https://journals.openedition.org/)) requires to develop the HTML versions of the Issue's contributions.

For this automatic transofmation from LaTeX to Word, we use the useful commanline tool [pandoc](http://pandoc.org). Before we can commense this transformation, however, we need to simplify our LaTeX in a way that makes it easier for pandoc to process our `.tex` files. This intermediary step is what is recorded in this branch of our repository.
